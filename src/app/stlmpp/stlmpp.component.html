      <p>Hello, I'm stLmpp.</p>
      <p>
        I play The Mercenaries since Resident Evil 4. Peaked at Resident Evil 5 and 6, but always had the same problem
        as everyone else, the leaderboards (when existent) were full of cheaters.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a long time, the community used to have a sheet with all scores from Resident Evil 5, but it was not that
        updated, and had a lot of flaws, because there were no (explicit) regulations and the updates were dependent on
        some people.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I had the idea of creating this site, to keep a clean and legit leaderboards, and add support for others
        Resident Evil games too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resident Evil Village recently (2021) launched, and there's no in-game leaderboards, so I saw an opportunity to
        launch the site.
